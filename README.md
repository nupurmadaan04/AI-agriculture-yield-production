# ðŸŒ¾ AI in Agriculture: Crop Monitoring and Yield Prediction

## ðŸ“„ Project Overview

This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict **Rice Yield (Kg/ha)** based on agricultural data such as year, area of cultivation, production, and state. It demonstrates the use of **EDA**, **outlier removal**, **data preprocessing**, **model training**, and **evaluation**.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

### Source:

- `Crops_data.csv` (original raw data)

### Derived Datasets:

- `rice_data.csv`: Extracted rice-related data
- `rice_data_outlier_removed.csv`: Cleaned rice dataset after removing outliers using IQR

## ðŸ“¢ Notes

- Outliers were removed using IQR before training.
- Data was scaled using `StandardScaler`.
- Cross-validation was also explored to prevent overfitting.
