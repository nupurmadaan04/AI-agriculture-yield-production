# 🌾 AI in Agriculture: Crop Monitoring and Yield Prediction

## 📄 Project Overview

This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict **Rice Yield (Kg/ha)** based on agricultural data such as year, area of cultivation, production, and state. It demonstrates the use of **EDA**, **outlier removal**, **data preprocessing**, **model training**, and **evaluation**.

## 📊 Dataset

### Source:

- `Crops_data.csv` (original raw data)

### Derived Datasets:

- `rice_data.csv`: Extracted rice-related data
- `rice_data_outlier_removed.csv`: Cleaned rice dataset after removing outliers using IQR
